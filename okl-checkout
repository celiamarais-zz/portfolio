			<h1>One Kings Lane - Checkout Redesign</h1>
				<div class="copy">When I started at One Kings Lane, its Checkout experience was dated, there was a lot of dropoff at each step (especially the payment one), and it was hurting conversion. There were too many steps, the experience was slow, cumbersome,and the forms onerous to fill. </div>
				<div class="noborder"><img src="/portfolio/images/UX_OCM_PDPs_borders.png"></div>
				<div class="copy">While we were planning the complete redesign, we first looked at the few quick wins that could be implemented with little resources. We did some competitive research, and simply started aligning ourselves with known best practices, and looked at simple ways to reduce the sheer number of fields a user had to fill. We implemented auto formatting for the Credit Cart field for example. Our customer service department was receiving lots of questions about Delivery Methods, so we worked with them to add answers and copy to more common questions on the right rail.<span class="dark">Our main hypothesis was that dropoff was being caused by too many steps and sections, and excessive friction at every step. We set out to reduce the number of steps, simplify the forms, and reduce as much as possible the number of decisions the customer would have to make throughout the process. We drastically reduced the number of sections to three, instead of five, merging the delivery method and order review steps. </span></div>
				<div class="noborder"><img src="/portfolio/images/OCM_reallife.png"></div>
				<div class="copy"> Our data was also showing many people clicking on disabled buttons, and that told us that people had a hard time situating themselves and knowing where they were in the process. We worked on setting expectations, by collapsing closed sections so that their total number would be visible as soon as you would land on the page. We also numbered sections and provided clear goal posts - 1 of 3.</div>
				<div class="noborder"><img src="/portfolio/images/OCM_MultiScreen.png"></div>
				<div class="copy"> We also made the payment and delivery and review sections inaccessible until their preceding one was completed. We helped the user focus on the task at hand by collapsing completed and inactive sections so users could focus on the task at hand.</div>
				<div class="noborder"><img src="/portfolio/images/VP_OCM_borders.png"></div>
				<div class="copy small">Finally, we drastically optimized the experience for returning customers, and made it a one click checkout. Our date showed us that most of our customers only had one payment method on file, so we made the decision to optimize for this. We made the decision to assume that that the user would, as in most cases, use the same shipping address and payment section, collapsed these sections by default, and only surfaced the CVV field - the only required field for a returning customer.</div>
				<div class="copy"><span class="dark">The result is a streamlined, easier and straightforward experience for new and guest users, and a one click checkout for our returning customers - as short and easy as you can get, short of removing the CVV field - which we can't do. The percentage of users landing on the Checkout page that completed the process, and got to the confirmation page, increased by 10% overall - and across all cohorts - Guests, returning, registered, 1st time customers.</span></div>
