		<h1>The Vendor Portal</h1><div class="copy">Some of the challenges of an experience marketplace are sourcing and onboarding high quality, trustworthy providers, while managing a complex fulfillment model. When IfOnly first started, these tasks were done entirely manually and internally, at a very high cost.</div>
<div class="copy">The vendor portal's launch allowed us to start moving from a completely manual to a mostly automated supply acquisition and management process, a critical step toward scaling our business. </div> 
<div class="noborder"><img src="/portfolio/images/VP_SignUp.png"></div>
<div class="copy">A number of tools let our providers create their own shop and products. Once fully vetted, they can fulfill, manage, and schedule their orders and experiences without any intervention from IfOnly.</div>
<img src="/portfolio/images/VP_Interstitial01_morethan768_Culinary_v2.png">
<div class="copy"><span class="dark">The Interstitial Page</span> is a new vendor's home base. From there, they can complete their profile, set up their payout information and start creating their products.</div>
<img src="/portfolio/images/VP_PB.png">
<div class="copy"><span class="dark">The Product Builder</span> lets user create their listings. With many different possible product types, the goal was to simplify and streamline a very complex decision tree.</div>
<div class="noborder"><img src="/portfolio/images/VP_TodoList_borders.png"></div>
<div class="copy">In their <span class="dark">To-do List</span>, vendors get an overview of their pending tasks. They can manage shipping, and schedule or make changes experiences.</div>
<div class="noborder"><img src="/portfolio/images/VP_Conversations_borders.png"></div>
<div class="copy"><span class="dark">The Conversations Module</span> lets vendors and customers communicate without exchanging actual contact information, preserving both parties' privacy. It also allows us to control for quality, assuring the excellence of our customer service, a crucial part of IfOnly's brand. </div>
<img src="/portfolio/images/VP_Dashboard.png">
<div class="copy"><span class="dark">The Dashboard</span> gives vendors an overview of their shop's performance and statistics, and displays the day's most important tasks and messages. </div>
<div class="copy"><span class="dark">Since its launch, the vendor portal has allowed us to vastly reduce our acquisition cost.</span> It is constantly being improved, and features planned include improved scheduling, new buying modalities, and text messaging integration.</div>
