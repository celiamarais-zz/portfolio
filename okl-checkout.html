			<h1>One Kings Lane - Checkout Redesign<br><br><br></h1>
				<div class="noborder"><img src="/portfolio/images/Checkout - Existing Desktop Guest.gif" width="40%"></div>
				<div class="copy">When I started at One Kings Lane, the Checkout experience was not performing well: we were seeing high drop-off rates, and this was hurting our conversion.</div>
<img src="/portfolio/images/CCM-2017 Checkout Existing Mobile.png" width="40%">
            <div class="copy small">There were many steps and sections, the experience was slow, cumbersome, and the forms onerous to fill. </div>
            <div class="copy"> We started by doing some competitive research, and looking at what our data could tell us.</div>
            	<div class="noborder"><img src="/portfolio/images/Checkout - Research.png" width="40%"></div>
			<div class="copy">As we were starting this process, we implemented a few quick wins that could be achieved with few resources.</div><img src="/portfolio/images/CCform.gif" width"20%"
><div class="copy small"> For example, we implemented auto formatting for the Credit Cart field - a simple best practice. Our customer service department was receiving lots of questions about delivery, so we worked with them to add answers most common ones below the order summary.</div><div class="copy">Our main hypothesis was that dropoff was being caused by too many steps and sections, and excessive friction at every step. <span class="dark">We set out to reduce as much as possible the number of decisions, and steps the customer would have to make throughout the process. </span>We drastically reduced the number of sections to three, instead of five, merging the delivery method and order review steps. </div>
            <div class="copy"> Our data was showing many that many people were tapping on disabled buttons. Our hypothesis was that this was because they didn't know where they were in the process - that they were having a hard time situating themselves.<span class="dark">So we worked on setting expectations and providing clear goal posts. We numbered the sections, and collapsed the inactive ones so that the entire form would be visible as soon as they landed on the page.</span></div>
				<div class="noborder"><img src="/portfolio/images/CM 2017 - Checkout - Result Desktop.png"></div>
				<div class="copy"> We also made the payment and delivery and review sections inaccessible until their preceding one was completed. We helped users focus on the task at hand by collapsing completed and inactive sections.</div>
				<div class="noborder"><img src="/portfolio/images/CM 2017 - Checkout - Result Mobile.png"></div>
				<div class="copy">Finally, we drastically optimized the experience for returning customers. Our data showed us that most of our customers only had one payment method and shipping address on file. So we made the decision to show only the shipping address and payment section at first. We also collapsed these sections by default, as to not present the user with an unnessecary question. </div>
            <div class="noborder"><img src="/portfolio/images/CM 2017 - Checkout New Mobile.png"></div>
            <div class="copy small">The only form we surfaced is the CVV field for the alst used Credit Card - the only required field for a customer who already a shipping address and card on file (the vast majority of our payments are made via Credit Card).</div>
				<div class="copy">The result: a streamlined, easier and straightforward experience for new and guest users, and a one click checkout for our returning customers - as short and easy as you can get, short of removing the CVV field - which we can't do. <span class="dark">The percentage of users landing on the Checkout page that completed the process, and got to the confirmation page, increased by 10% overall - and across all cohorts - Guests, returning, registered, 1st time customers.</span></div>
