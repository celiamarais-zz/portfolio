			<h1>One Kings Lane - Checkout Redesign<br><br><br></h1>
				<img src="/portfolio/images/Checkout - New Desktop Guest.png" style="max-width: 680px;">
				<div class="copy">When I started at One Kings Lane, the Checkout experience was not performing well: we were seeing very high drop-off rates at every step. Our main hypothesis was that this was caused by too many steps, and excessive friction at every step. The experience was slow, cumbersome, and the forms onerous to fill. </div>
			<div class="noborder"><img src="/portfolio/images/Checkout - Existing.png" style="max-width: 800px;"></div>
            <div class="copy"> We started by doing some competitive research, and looking at our data.</div>
            	<div class="noborder"><img src="/portfolio/images/Checkout - Research.png" style="max-width: 580px;"></div>
			<div class="copy">As we were starting the process, we implemented a few quick and easy improvements that needed few resources.</div>
			<div class="noborder"><img src="/portfolio/images/Checkout - QW.png" max-width="500px"></div>
			<div class="copy small"> For example, we added auto-format to the credit Credit Cart field - a simple best practice. Our customer service department was receiving lots of questions about delivery, so we added answers to the most common ones below the order summary.</div>
			<div class="copy"><span class="dark">Our strategy was to reduce the number of decisions the user would need to much as much as possible.</span>We drastically reduced the number of sections to three, instead of five, merging the delivery method and order review steps. We also removed fields wherever we could.</div>
            <div class="copy"> An interesting data point was that many people were tapping on disabled buttons multiple times ("rage clicking"). This told us that they were having a hard time situating themselves within the page the process.<span class="dark">So we worked on setting expectations and providing clear goal posts: </span>we collapsed inactive sections on load so that the entire form would be visible as soon as a user landed on the page.</div>
		
	
				<div class="copy"> We helped users focus on the task at hand by collapsing completed steps automatically. We also made the payment section inaccessible until the preceding one was completed. </div>
				<div class="noborder"><img src="/portfolio/images/Checkout - Result Desktop.png" style="max-width: 800px;"></div><div class="noborder"><img src="/portfolio/images/Checkout - Result Mobile.png" style="max-width: 800px;"></div>
				<div class="copy">Our data showed us that most of our customers were returning, and only had one payment method and shipping address on file. So we drastically optimized the experience for returning customers: we collapsed the shipping and payment sections, and defaulted to the last used shipping address and credit card, and avoided asking a question that for the majority of our customers would be unecessary.</div>
            
            <div class="noborder"><img src="/portfolio/images/Checkout - New Desktop Guest.gif" style="max-width: 800px;"></div><div class="copy small">The only form we surfaced is the CVV field for the last used Credit Card - making the process as quick and easy as possible.</div>
				<div class="copy">The result: a streamlined, easier and straightforward experience for new and guest users, and a one click checkout for our returning customers. <span class="dark">The percentage of users landing on the Checkout page who completed a purchase increased by 10% overall.</span></div>
