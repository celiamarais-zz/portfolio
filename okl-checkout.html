			<h1>One Kings Lane Checkout</h1>
				<div class="copy">A redesign that achieved a near frictionless experience for our returning customers, and lead to a 10% increase in checkout completion rates. </div>		
				<img src="/portfolio/images/Checkout - New Desktop Guest.png" style="max-width: 100%;">	
            <div class="copy">The One Kings Lane checkout experience was not performing well. There were many steps, and we were seeing high drop-off rates. We believed this was hurting conversion, and our goal was to remove as much friction as possible. We wanted to move fast, so I started with a few small improvements to the existing page that could be implemented quickly.</div>
            	<div class="noborder"><img src="/portfolio/images/Checkout - QW.png" style="max-width: 50%;"></div>
			<div class="copy small"> For example, our customer service department was receiving a lot of questions about delivery - so we showed answers to the most common ones below the order summary. We also added auto-formatting to the credit cart field - a simple best practice. </div>	
            <div class="copy"> We did some research, looked at our data, and I started iterating sketches and wireframes.<span class="dark"> My approach was to set clear expectations, and reduce as much as possible the number of decisions a customer would need to take before completing their purchase.</span> </div>
		    <div class="noborder"><img src="/portfolio/images/Checkout - Iterations.png" style="max-width: 100%;"></div>
				<div class="copy">Our data showed us that many people were tapping or clicking disabled buttons multiple times. They weren't sure what to do next, and were having a hard time situating themselves within the flow. <span class="dark"> So we established clear goal posts,</span> numbering the sections and reducing the overall form height. <span class="dark">We helped users focus on the task at hand</span> by collapsing any completed or inactive sections, and making each step inaccessible until the preceeding one had been completed.</div>
			<div class="noborder"><img src="/portfolio/images/Checkout - Existing.png" style="max-width: 100%;"></div>
			<div class="copy">The data showed us that more than half of our customers were returning, and that most had only one payment method and shipping address on file. So we decided to default to the last used shipping address and payment method if a customer was returning, and collapsed those sections upon landing.</div><div class="noborder"><img src="/portfolio/images/Checkout - Result Mobile.png" style="max-width: 100%;"></div>
				<div class="copy">This drastically optimized the experience for a big part of our users, who now only have to enter their CVV before checking out.</div>
            				<img src="/portfolio/images/Checkout - New Desktop Returning.gif" style="max-width: 100%;">
				<div class="copy">The result: a streamlined, easier and straightforward experience for new and guest users, a one click checkout for our returning customers, <span class="dark">and a 10% increase in the number of users landing on the checkout page who completed their purchase.</span></div>
