			<h1>One Kings Lane - Checkout Redesign<br><br><br></h1>
				<img src="/portfolio/images/Checkout - New Desktop Guest.png" style="max-width: 680px;">
				<div class="copy">When I started at One Kings Lane, the Checkout experience was not performing well: we were seeing high drop-off rates, and this was hurting our conversion.</div>
			<div class="noborder"><img src="/portfolio/images/Checkout - Existing.png"></div>
            <div class="copy small">There were many steps and sections, the experience was slow, cumbersome, and the forms onerous to fill. </div>
            <div class="copy"> We started by doing some competitive research, and looking at what our data could tell us.</div>
            	<div class="noborder"><img src="/portfolio/images/Checkout - Research.png" style="max-width: 580px;"></div>
			<div class="copy">As we were starting the process, we implemented a few quick and easy improvements that needed few resources.</div><div class=noborder><img src="/portfolio/images/Checkout - QW.png" style="max-width: 580px;"
></div><div class="copy small"> For example, we added auto-format to the credit Credit Cart field - a simple best practice. Our customer service department was receiving lots of questions about delivery, so added answers to the most common ones below the order summary.</div><div class="copy">Our main hypothesis was that dropoff was being caused by too many steps, and excessive friction at every step. <span class="dark">Our strategy was to reduce the number of decisions the user would need to make as much as possible. What questions do we not need to ask? </span>We drastically reduced the number of sections to three, instead of five, merging the delivery method and order review steps. We reduced the number of fields.</div>
            <div class="copy"> The data was showing many that many people were tapping on disabled buttons. Our hypothesis was that this was because they didn't know where they were in the process - that they were having a hard time situating themselves.<span class="dark">So we worked on setting expectations and providing clear goal posts. We collapsed inactive sections by default so that the entire form would be visible as soon as a user landed on the page.</span></div>
				<div class="noborder"><img src="/portfolio/images/Checkout - Result Desktop.png" style="max-width: 700px;"></div>
				<div class="copy"> We helped users focus on the task at hand by collapsing completed steps automatically. We also made the payment section inaccessible until the preceding one was completed. </div>
				<div class="noborder"><img src="/portfolio/images/Checkout - Result Mobile.png" style="max-width: 700px;"></div>
				<div class="copy">Finally, we drastically optimized the experience for returning customers. Our data showed us that most of our customers were returning, and only had one payment method and shipping address on file. So we made the decision to collapse the Shipping and Payment sections by default, and defaulted to the last used Shipping Address and Credit Card, avoiding asking a question that would be unecessary in most cases. </div>
            <div class="noborder"><img src="/portfolio/images/Checkout - New Desktop Guest.gif" style="max-width: 700px;"></div>
            <div class="copy small">The only form we surfaced is the CVV field for the last used Credit Card - making the process as quick and easy as possible.</div>
				<div class="copy">The result: a streamlined, easier and straightforward experience for new and guest users, and a one click checkout for our returning customers. <span class="dark">The percentage of users landing on the Checkout page who completed a purchase, increased by 10% overall - and across all cohorts - Guests, Returning, Registered, First time customers.</span></div>
