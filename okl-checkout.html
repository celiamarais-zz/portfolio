			<h1>One Kings Lane - Checkout Redesign<br><br><br></h1>
				<div class="copy">The One Kings Lane checkout experience was not performing well. We were seeing high drop-off rates, there were many steps, and the forms were onerous to fill. The experience felt slow and cumbersome, and we believed this was hurting conversion. We needed to remove as much friction as possible.  </div>
			<div class="noborder"><img src="/portfolio/images/Checkout - Existing.png" style="max-width: 800px;"></div>
            <div class="copy">We wanted to move fast, so I started with a few small improvements to the existing page that could be implemented quickly.</div>
            	<div class="noborder"><img src="/portfolio/images/Checkout - QW.png" style="max-width: 600px;"></div>
			<div class="copy small"> For example, our customer service department was receiving a lot of questions about delivery - so we showed some answers to the most common ones below the order summary. We also added auto-format to the credit Credit Cart field - a simple best practice. </div>	
            <div class="copy"> We looked at competitive research, looking at our data, and I started iterating sketches and wireframes.<span class="dark"> My approach was to set clear expectations, and reduce as much as possible the number of decisions a customer would need to make before completing their purchase.</span> </div>
		    <div class="noborder"><img src="/portfolio/images/Checkout - Iterations.png" style="max-width: 900px;"><div>
		    <div class="copy"></div>The data told us that many people were tapping or clicking disabled buttons multiple times, or rage clicking. They were having a hard time situating themselves within the checkout flow, and weren't sure what to do next<span class="dark"> We worked on providing clear goal posts, and helping users focus on the task at hand.</span> I numbered the steps, and made each one clearly inaccessible until the preceeding one had been completed, and reduced the overall height of the checkout form. I helped users focus by collapsing any completed or inactive sections.</div>
				<img src="/portfolio/images/Checkout - New Desktop Guest.png" style="max-width: 800px;">
			<div class="copy">The data showed us that more than half of our customers were returning, most having only one payment method and shipping address on file. So we decided we would default to the last used shipping address and payment method, and collapse the shipping and payment sections for our returning customers <span class="dark">- we anticipated that most of them wouldn't need to be asked these questions.</div><div class="noborder"><img src="/portfolio/images/Checkout - Result Mobile.png" style="max-width: 700px;"></div>
				<div class="copy">This drastically optimized the experience for a majority of users.</div>
            				<img src="/portfolio/images/Checkout - New Desktop Returning.gif" style="max-width: 800px;">
            <div class="copy small">The only information we ask for is the CVV of the last used Credit Card - making the process as quick and easy as possible.</div>
				<div class="copy">The result: a streamlined, easier and straightforward experience for new and guest users, a one click checkout for our returning customers, <span class="dark">and a 10% increase in the number of users landing on the checkout page who completed their purchase.</span></div>
