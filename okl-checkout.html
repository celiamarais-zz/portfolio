			<h1>One Kings Lane - Checkout Redesign<br><br><br></h1>
				<img src="/portfolio/images/Checkout - New Desktop Guest.png" style="max-width: 680px;">
				<div class="copy">The One Kings Lane checkout experience was not performing well. We were seeing high drop-off rates on the checkout page - there were many steps, and the forms were onerous to fill. The experience felt slow and cumbersome, and we believed this was hurting conversion.  </div>
			<div class="noborder"><img src="/portfolio/images/Checkout - Existing.png" style="max-width: 800px;"></div>
            <div class="copy">There were simply too many hurdles to purchase for our customers, and we knew we needed to remove as much friction as possible from that page, and we wanted to redesign it. We wanted to move fast, so we started by implementing a few quick and easy improvements to the existing page that would demand few resources.</div>
            	<div class="noborder"><img src="/portfolio/images/Checkout - QW.png" style="max-width: 520px;"></div>
			<div class="copy small"> For example, our customer service department was receiving a lot of questions about delivery - so we added answers to the most common ones below the order summary. We also added auto-format to the credit Credit Cart field - a simple best practice. </div>
			<div class="copy">We started doing a bit of competitive research, and looking at our data.</div>
			<div class="noborder"><img src="/portfolio/images/Checkout - Research.png" style="max-width: 480px;"></div>		
            <div class="copy"> <span class="dark">Our goal was to remove friction by reducing the number of decisions the user would need to make before completing their purchase.</span> We brought the number of steps down to three instead of five, and removed fields wherever we could. We noticed that many people were tapping or clicking disabled buttons multiple times, or rage clicking. This told us that they were having a hard time situating themselves within the checkout flow, and weren't sure what to do next. <span class="dark">We worked on setting expectations, providing clear goal posts, and helping users focus on the task at hand.</span> We numbered the steps, and made each one clearly inaccessible until its preceding one had been completed. We helped users focus by collapsing any completed or inactive sections. We reduced the overall height of the checkout form so it would be entirely visible upon landing.</div>
			<img src="/portfolio/images/Checkout - New Desktop Guest.png" style="max-width: 680px;">
			<div class="copy"><span class="dark">The data showed us that more than half of our customers were returning, most having only one payment method and shipping address on file. <br><br><span class="dark">So we decided we would default to the last used shipping address and payment method and collapse the shipping and payment sections for our returning customers - we anticipating that most of them wouldn't need to be asked these questions. This drastically optimized the experience for a majority of users. </span></div>
	
            				<div class="noborder"><img src="/portfolio/images/Checkout - New Desktop Returning.gif" style="max-width: 600px;"><img src="/portfolio/images/Checkout - Result Mobile.png" style="max-width: 700px;"></div>
            <div class="copy small">The only form we surface is the CVV field for the last used Credit Card - making the process as quick and easy as possible.</div>
				<div class="copy">The result: a streamlined, easier and straightforward experience for new and guest users, and a one click checkout for our returning customers, <span class="dark">and a 10% increase in the number of users landing on the Checkout page who completed their purchase.</span></div>
