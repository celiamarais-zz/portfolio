			<h1>One Kings Lane - Checkout Redesign<br><br><br></h1>
				<img src="/portfolio/images/Checkout - New Desktop Guest.png" style="max-width: 680px;">
				<div class="copy">The One Kings Lane checkout experience was not performing well. We were seeing a high drop-off rates on the checkout page - there were many steps, and the forms were onerous to fill. The experience felt slow and cumbersome. We believed this was hurting conversion.  </div>
			<div class="noborder"><img src="/portfolio/images/Checkout - Existing.png" style="max-width: 800px;"></div>
            <div class="copy">There were simply too many hurdles to purchase for our customers, and we knew we needed as much friction as possible on that page. We wanted to move fast, so started by implementing a few quick and easy improvements that demanded few resources.</div>
            	<div class="noborder"><img src="/portfolio/images/Checkout - QW.png" style="max-width: 520px;"></div>
			<div class="copy small"> For example, our customer service department was receiving a lot of questions about delivery - so we added answers to the most common ones below the order summary. We also added auto-format to the credit Credit Cart field - a simple best practice. </div>
			<div class="copy">We also decided to embark on a wider redesign, starting by looking at data, and doing some competitive research.</div>
			<div class="noborder"><img src="/portfolio/images/Checkout - Research.png" style="max-width: 480px;"></div>		
            <div class="copy"> An interesting data point was that many people were tapping on disabled buttons multiple times, or rage clicking. This told us that they were having a hard time situating themselves within the checkout flow, and weren't sure what to do next. <span class="dark">So we worked on setting expectations, providing clear goal posts, and helping users focus on the task at hand.</span> We numbered the sections, and made them clearly inaccessible until their preceding one had been completed. We helped users focus on the task at hand by collapsing any completed or inactive section. We reduced the overall height of the form so it would be entirely visible upon landing on screen.</div>

			<div class="copy"><span class="dark">We also set out to remove friction, and reduce the number of decisions the user would need to make before completing their purchase.</span> We brought the number of steps down to three instead of five and removed fields wherever we could.<br><br>The data showed us that more than half of our customers were returning, most of which had only had one payment method and shipping address on file. <br><br><span class="dark">So we decided to collapse the shipping and payment sections, and default to the last used shipping address and credit card for our returning customers, drastically optimizing the experience for a majority of users. </span></div>

            <div class="copy small">The only form we surface is the CVV field for the last used Credit Card - making the process as quick and easy as possible.</div>
				<div class="copy">The result: a streamlined, easier and straightforward experience for new and guest users, and a one click checkout for our returning customers, <span class="dark">and a 10% increase in the number of users landing on the Checkout page who completed their purchase.</span></div>
